krakencoder_origHCP.py:  this contains raw data from original HCPA, HCPD, val+test HCPYA data for original krakencoder
krakencoder_origHCP_newYA.py: this contains raw data from new HCPYA, original HCPA, HCPD; newHCPYA has same acquisition as HCPA, D; same process pipeline as original HCPYA

raw_newYA_addtraining_logistic_ensemble.py (the one we finally used to predict sex)
raw_newYA_addtraining_logistic_ensembletimelog.py 
    (same as raw_newYA_addtraining_logistic_ensemble.py, 
    but adding time log to look at the progress; 
    in the experiment, we only used this to train sc coco439 ifod2act, sdstream mul_etiv=True;
    other flavors are trained by raw_newYA_addtraining_logistic_ensemble.py, 
    including add fcs, and SC shen268, fs86 mul_etiv=True)

raw_newYA_addtraining_logistic_ensemble_site.py (use original data to predict site)

xxx_ensemble_covbat.py : apply covbat to all data; predict sex
xxx_ensemble_covbat_site.py: apply covbat to all data; predict site
